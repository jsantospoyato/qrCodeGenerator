# QR CODE GENERATOR

## Author: Juan Santos Poyato

## What is this app for?

The name is self-descriptive.

## How does it work?

It asks for a URL and a path to save the (png) file that has been generated containing the QR code from the URL given. The added bonus of this program is that it checks the libraries that are needed to execute the script and so that the user can choose to install them or not and guide them in doing so.
